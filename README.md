# Batch-Farm-Simulator

This is a farm simulator game written in batch. This game was started a couple years, but after several difficult bugs, I decided to discontinue until I recently started back up on the project.

The code is around 80% complete from what it was originaly inteaded to do. And is about 90% bug free.

What's left is:

-Finishing the sell menu and tend to animals menu.
-Adding the ability to rase the players level past level 2
-Adding the ability to modify the players energy.

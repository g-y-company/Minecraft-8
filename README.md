# Batch-Farm-Simulator

This is a farm simulator game written in batch. This game was started a couple years, but after several difficult bugs, I decided to discontinue until I recently started back up on the project.

The code is around 90% complete from what it was originaly inteaded to do. And is about 95% bug free.

What's left is:

-Adding the ability to rase the players level past level 2.
-Adding the ability to modify the players energy.

INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Restore default buffer size and window size for cmd if changed.
2. Run Farm.bat anywere you want (it is a 100% portable application although the save file will be placed on the users userprofile directory ex. c:\users\xp4xbox)

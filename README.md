# Batch-Farm-Simulator

This is a farm simulator game written in batch. This game was started a couple years, but after several difficult bugs, I decided to discontinue until I recently started back up on the project.

The code is 100% complete from what it was originaly inteaded to do. And is about 95% bug free.

## Features To Add In The Future:

-Adding the ability to rase the players level past level 3.

-Adding Potatoes As A Crop In The Game

-Adding Sheep As An Animal In The Game

## Installation Instructions:

1. Restore default buffer size and window size for cmd if changed.
2. Run Farm.bat anywere you want. (it is a 100% portable application although the save file will be placed in the user's userprofile directory ex. c:\users\xp4xbox)

#### NOTE: If the original file does not work or closes unexpectedly, try using compiled .exe. If you still encounter any issues, please post an issue.
